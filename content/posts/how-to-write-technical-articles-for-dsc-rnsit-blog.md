## General Instructions
* Learn to use Markdown for writing articles. Its really easy to learn, and helps a lot in text formatting.
* Always use present tense in writing technical articles. Furthermore, the use of words like “will” tends to lead to thinking and writing about what will be done. Conversely, when the article is written in the present tense, the language is clear and unambiguous.   
* Avoid lengthy, complex paragraphs. In case your article will appear in columns, even one or two sentences equal a paragraph.   
* Avoid use of passive voice.
* Expand all acronyms on first use, except acronyms that every reader is expected to know.
* Avoid “etc.” unless it is obvious.
* Make sure you read your article several times and use spell-check. Though it may be obvious, this is one of the most important tips. If you are careless making silly spelling mistakes, editors will just reject your article.
* Never write an article on a topic which you are not confident. Make sure you work out all steps and give fair amount of information to your readers.
* When providing data in form of numbers that include facts, always provide the source of information. For example “20,000 nodes on internet as per XYZ research paper dated ..”
